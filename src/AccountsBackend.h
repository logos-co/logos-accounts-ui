// The Accounts backend.
//
// It decides nothing. Every account question -- what the vault holds, what the
// log says, whether an edit is legal, what a publish writes -- is answered by
// the linked-in Rust library, and this class marshals: JSON in from the
// library, properties out to the view, the view's strings back in.
//
// It is a `ui_qml` backend, so the runtime hands it no data directory the way
// it hands a core module `instance_persistence_path`. The vault path is
// therefore this app's own choice, and `vaultDirectory()` is where that choice
// lives.
//
// Threading: the two calls that reach the store take as long as the store
// takes, and a slot that blocks here blocks the view behind it. So every call
// runs on a one-thread pool and comes back through the event loop, and `busy`
// is what the view guards its buttons with.
