# Role: doc-test display entry (the `#walkthrough` flake app); wraps run-walkthrough.sh then holds the window open.
# Write a whole account log, then hold the window open showing the finished
# log: the entry point for the `#walkthrough` flake app the doc-test drives.
#
# The app binds its QML inspector the moment it starts, so a doc-test attaching
# to the default port would screenshot the empty-vault door rather than the log.
# This splits the work: the walkthrough runs first, on its own inspector port,
# and the instance is *kept alive* with the published log on screen. Only once
# it is done does SHOW_PORT open, as a TCP proxy onto that live inspector. The
# doc-test attaches to the finished window and screenshots it, while the
# walkthrough itself has already happened during the unbounded launch port-wait.
#
# Usage:
#   run-walkthrough-show.sh [base-dir]
# Env:
#   APP_BIN     run-logos-standalone-ui path (baked in by the flake app)
#   SHOW_PORT   capture port the doc-test attaches to (default 3768)
#   OUT_DIR     where the numbered screenshots are written (default <base>/images)
