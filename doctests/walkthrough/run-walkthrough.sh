#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Role: headless walkthrough test driver (CI); see run-walkthrough-show.sh for the doc-test display variant.
# Regenerate the account-log walkthrough screenshots in doctests/images.
#
# Launches one logos-accounts-ui instance offscreen on an empty vault and an
# in-process store, drives the whole walkthrough through its own QML surface via
# the logos-qt-mcp inspector protocol (run-walkthrough.mjs), and writes the
# numbered screenshots to OUT_DIR. Exits non-zero if any checkpoint is missed,
# so this doubles as an end-to-end integration check.
#
# Usage:
#   doctests/walkthrough/run-walkthrough.sh [out-dir]
# Env:
#   FLAKE          flake ref to build the app from (default ".")
#   APP_BIN        run-logos-standalone-ui path; if unset, built from FLAKE
#   OUT_DIR        screenshot dir (default arg1, else doctests/images)
#   WORK_DIR       vault/log dir; if unset, a fresh mktemp is used
#   KEEP_WORK_DIR  if set, WORK_DIR is left in place on exit (e.g. to keep the
#                  app log); the process is still torn down
#   KEEP_INSTANCE  if set, a *successful* run leaves the app running (and its
#                  WORK_DIR in place) and the caller owns its teardown; a failed
#                  run still tears everything down
