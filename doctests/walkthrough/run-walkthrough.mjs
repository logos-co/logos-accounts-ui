// Write a whole account log by driving an already-running logos-accounts-ui
// instance, and capture a screenshot of each step for the docs.
//
// The walkthrough is a sequence of screens, and each step is finished when the
// app says so -- a key exists, a sheet is up, an entry is staged, the store
// serves it. This driver speaks the logos-qt-mcp inspector protocol directly,
// so every step waits on the app's own state rather than on a timer, and the
// screenshot is taken once that state has been reached. Launch + teardown of
// the app is handled by run-walkthrough.sh; this script attaches to the
// inspector port it is given.
//
// Nothing here reaches past the QML the person sees: the controls are found by
// objectName and clicked, the fields are filled by writing their `text`, and
// the account library is only ever called the way a button calls it.
//
// Env:
//   APP_PORT   inspector port (default 3768)
